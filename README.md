  <h3 align="center">Cowsay Hack Day</h3>
</p>
<p align="center">
Cowsay Hack Day is a one day hackathon where participants, grouped in teams (of 2-6 people) are building software OR hardware solution what does not necessarily bring any value, or solve any practical problem. The primordial scope of the event is having fun by coding/building barely useless products and engaging with other participants.
<br>
  <strong>No Business Plan. No Value Proposition. Code. Networking. Fun.</strong>

  <br>
  Hackathon format was inspired by existing “Stupid Hackathon” (more details <a href="http://www.stupidhackathon.com/">here</a>)
</p>


<br>

## (no)Rules
Honestly speaking we don’t have any rules, besides some general socially accepted norms of conduct like:
* Don’t build racist/sexist/discriminatory products.
* Be a team player. Do not conflict/insult other participants.

_We reserve the right to disqualify (or kick off you) if other participants agreed that your comportment is inappropriate._
